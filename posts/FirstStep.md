My journey in web development started when I purchased a course in **Udemy**. I choose the **Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu**. I choose this because I wanted to pursue full-stack web development.
I started the course in May of 2021, after arriving home from a long work trip in Dutch Harbor, Alaska where I worked as a Fisheries Observer.

The initial modules were easy as they were an introduction to HTML, CSS, and web design. In these modules, we made a few websites, although static websites but pretty. The first site I made was a CV which can be found <a href="https://pocotashi.github.io/cv/">here</a>. This was fun to make as it was not too difficult, and the website was very applicable to me. Once bootstrap was introduced, I applied it in making another website called tindog, which was Angela's version of tinder for dogs.

The next module in the course was JavaScript. The introduction to JavaScript and most of the intermediate to JavaScript content was relatively straightforward because of my previous experience in python.
Before taking on this online Bootcamp, I had dabbled in python years ago. When I started the course, it was mid-May, and once Mid June had arrived, I had to go to upstate NY for work. The work was for full time, but I worked on the course bit at a time. Once summer was over, that was when my full-time learning began. More on that in the next blog.
