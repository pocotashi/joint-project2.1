As summer was coming to an end I had made some progress in the Bootcamp course but the pace was slower than I would have liked. Granted I was working full time in a summer camp. However, I had decided that I would give myself a month of studying full time and learn as much as I could in that period before heading back to Alaska for work.

Before venturing into this month of full-time studying I asked my friend to mentor me. I asked him because he is an iOS developer with experience in web development and luckily he agreed to do so. The month was quite challenging, it was a fast-paced, intense month-long Bootcamp. I was going over to my friend's place Monday to Friday, 8 hours a day and on weekend did some learning on my own.

The first day started with learning about establishing workflow and agile development. After that, I watched some youtube tutorials on introduction to React.js and read some parts of the React docs. We also came up with a few project ideas that I would like to work on. I choose to work on the recipe website and got started on it. The rest of the week was an introduction to Node.js, Express, DOM, and git. I also downloaded a few React projects and looked at the code to try and understand the working of it. Also, I continued working on the recipe website where I wanted to map and render various recipes on the page but I was unable to do so. Towards the end of the week, I realized the difficulty of this journey but I was still motivated to continue.

The second week, I continued with the schedule but worked at my own place. I worked on the **Udemy course** and worked through the DOM, Advanced JavaScript and DOM manipulation, jQuery, and command-line modules. I also worked on two boss-level challenges, and as the name indicates this was quite a challenge. The first challenge was a dice game, where based on the output of the dice roll the H1 changes, and the winner is declared. The neat part of this challenge that I like is the change of the dice images and the comparison of the images' value allows for a winner to be decided.

The second boss challenge was the Simon says challenge. In this challenge, there are four different colored boxes and each with a distinct sound. The goal is to simply click the cube that made the most recent sound. The level increments as you continue to get the right answer but it resets when you get it wrong. However, the pattern is quite simple, each round only one cube is pressed and the previous pattern does not carry over to the next level. This is something I would like to add to it real soon.

The third week, I was back at my friend's place and started learning how to use API. There was more React and more failing to render. I also revisited some project ideas and went over the structure and functionalities that I would like them to have. Doing so kept me motivated to keep going despite my struggles in learning. The third week was the most intense week. It had me questioning my choice of wanting to pursue this career. However, after coming this far and encouragement from my mentor I kept ongoing. In the fourth week, I continued with git and finished the ejs module. Also, worked on a blog website challenge.

Overall, the month was very challenging, and there were moments where I felt like giving it all up. However, I persevered and pushed through. This was truly my first serious step towards becoming a full-stack web developer and I would like to thank my friend who agreed to mentor me and help me in my journey. Also, would like to thank Dr. Google as well.
